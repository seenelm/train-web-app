        <h2 className="section-title">4. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Commitment:</strong> Due to our encryption system with no decryption capability, we cannot and will not sell your personal data to advertisers or other third parties. Your information remains securely encrypted with no technical means for us to convert it to a readable format for sharing or selling.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share information only in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul className="privacy-list">
          <li><strong>With other users:</strong> When you use social features of our App, information you provide may be displayed to other users.</li>
          <li><strong>With service providers:</strong> We share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>For legal reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests. However, due to our advanced encryption system with no decryption capability, any data shared would be in encrypted form and would appear as gibberish. We have deliberately designed our systems so that we cannot decrypt user data for sharing with any third party, including government entities. We will vigorously defend user privacy and only share the minimum required information when legally compelled to do so.</li>
          <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share information with third parties when you give us consent to do so.</li>
        </ul>

      <section className="privacy-section">
        <h2 className="section-title">5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          At Train, we implement industry-leading encryption technology to protect your data. All user information is encrypted using advanced cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that your data is stored in a format that appears as gibberish to any human viewer, including our own staff members.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Our system is designed with no decryption capability for human access. We have deliberately removed the technical ability to decrypt user data for purposes like selling or sharing with third parties. This means we <em>cannot</em> access your readable data even if we wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our proprietary encryption system ensures that:
        </p>
        <ul className="privacy-list">
          <li><strong>End-to-end encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-knowledge architecture:</strong> Even our own employees cannot access your unencrypted data</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithmic processing only:</strong> Only our secure, automated algorithms can process your information within our closed system</li>
          <li><strong>No decryption capability:</strong> We have deliberately designed our systems without the ability to decrypt data for human viewing or third-party sharing</li>
          <li><strong>Secure key management:</strong> Encryption keys are managed through a sophisticated system that prevents unauthorized access</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach provides an exceptional level of privacy and security, as we have technically eliminated the possibility of selling or sharing your readable data. While no security system is 100% impenetrable, our encryption-first approach with no decryption capability significantly reduces risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, or commercial exploitation of your personal information.
